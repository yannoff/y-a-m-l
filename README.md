# Y . A . M . L

## Y.A.M.L : Yaml Abstraction Model Layer

An abstraction layer for YAML, written in PHP.

### Why are we here ?

This library was conceived as an enhancement to the [symfony/yaml](https://github.com/symfony/yaml) component, providing uncovered _- yet much needed -_ features to handle YAML contents, required by the [yamltools](https://github.com/yannoff/yamltools) project.

### Installation

Via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) :

```bash
composer require yannoff/y-a-m-l
```
